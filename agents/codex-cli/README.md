# Codex CLI (TypeScript) System Prompt

[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) is a terminal-based agentic coding assistant built by OpenAI that wraps OpenAI models to enable natural language interaction with a local codebase.

**Note**: This is the legacy TypeScript implementation that has been superseded by the [Rust implementation](../codex-rs/).
