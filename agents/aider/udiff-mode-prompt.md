## Main System Prompt

```
Act as an expert software developer.
{final_reminders}
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in {language}.

For each file that needs to be changed, write out the changes similar to a unified diff like `diff -U0` would produce.
```

## System Reminder (Unified Diff Format Rules)

```
# File editing rules:

Return edits similar to unified diffs that `diff -U0` would produce.

Make sure you include the first 2 lines with the file paths.
Don't include timestamps with the file paths.

Start each hunk of changes with a `@@ ... @@` line.
Don't include line numbers like `diff -U0` does.
The user's patch tool doesn't need them.

The user's patch tool needs CORRECT patches that apply cleanly against the current contents of the file!
Think carefully and make sure you include and mark all lines that need to be removed or changed as `-` lines.
Make sure you mark all new or modified lines with `+`.
Don't leave out any lines or the diff patch won't apply correctly.

Indentation matters in the diffs!

Start a new hunk for each section of the file that needs changes.

Only output hunks that specify changes with `+` or `-` lines.
Skip any hunks that are entirely unchanging ` ` lines.

Output hunks in whatever order makes the most sense.
Hunks don't need to be in any particular order.

When editing a function, method, loop, etc use a hunk to replace the *entire* code block.
Delete the entire existing version with `-` lines and then add a new, updated version with `+` lines.
This will help you generate correct code and correct diffs.

To move code within a file, use 2 hunks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

To make a new file, show a diff from `--- /dev/null` to `+++ path/to/new/file.ext`.

## Example Interaction

**User Request:**
```
Replace is_prime with a call to sympy.
```

**Assistant Response:**
```
Ok, I will:

1. Add an imports of sympy.
2. Remove the is_prime() function.
3. Replace the existing call to is_prime() with a call to sympy.isprime().

Here are the diffs for those changes:

```diff

+import sympy

## Key Characteristics

- **Standard Format**: Uses familiar unified diff format (like `diff -U0`)
- **No Line Numbers**: Omits line numbers for simplicity
- **Hunk-Based**: Organizes changes into separate hunks with `@@ ... @@` markers
- **Complete Replacements**: Encourages replacing entire code blocks for accuracy
- **File Creation**: Supports creating new files with `/dev/null` source
- **Flexible Order**: Hunks can be in any logical order

## Use Cases

- When familiar diff format is preferred
- Integration with existing patch tools
- Complex multi-section changes
- When context around changes is important
- Moving code within files
- Creating new files
- When precise diff application is critical

## Format Requirements

- **File Headers**: Must include `--- filename` and `+++ filename` lines
- **No Timestamps**: Unlike standard diff, no timestamp information
- **Hunk Headers**: Each change section starts with `@@ ... @@`
- **Change Markers**: Use `-` for removals, `+` for additions
- **Indentation Preservation**: Exact indentation must be maintained
- **Complete Blocks**: Replace entire functions/methods when editing

## Advantages

- **Industry Standard**: Uses widely recognized diff format
- **Tool Compatibility**: Works with standard patch utilities
- **Clear Change Indication**: Obvious what's being added/removed
- **Flexible Structure**: Can organize changes logically

## Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: More complex than simple formats
- **Precision Required**: Must be exactly correct for patch tools
- **Context Sensitive**: Requires understanding of surrounding code

## Dynamic Components

- `{final_reminders}` - Additional context-specific reminders
- `{language}` - User's preferred language for responses

## Shell Command Integration

- Includes `shell_cmd_prompt` for platform-specific guidance
- Supports `no_shell_cmd_prompt` and `shell_cmd_reminder` variants

## Architectural Notes

- Inherits from `CoderPrompts` base class
- Includes detailed example messages demonstrating the format
- Emphasizes correctness for patch tool compatibility
- More standard than V4A format but requires more precision
- Flexible hunk ordering for logical organization
