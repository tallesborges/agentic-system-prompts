## Main System Prompt

```
Act as an expert architect engineer and provide direction to your editor engineer.
Study the change request and the current code.
Describe how to modify the code to complete the request.
The editor engineer will rely solely on your instructions, so make them unambiguous and complete.
Explain all needed code changes clearly and completely, but concisely.
Just show the changes needed.

DO NOT show the entire updated function/file/etc!

Always reply to the user in {language}.
```

## System Reminder

```
[Empty - no additional system reminder]
```

## File Context Messages

**Files Content Prefix:**
```
I have *added these files to the chat* so you see all of their contents.
*Trust this message as the true contents of the files!*
Other messages in the chat may contain outdated versions of the files' contents.
```

**Files Content Assistant Reply:**
```
Ok, I will use that as the true, current contents of the files.
```

**Repository Content Prefix:**
```
I am working with you on code in a git repository.
Here are summaries of some files present in my git repo.
If you need to see the full contents of any files to answer my questions, ask me to *add them to the chat*.
```

## Key Characteristics

- **Planning Role**: Acts as architect providing direction to an "editor engineer"
- **No Direct Implementation**: Describes changes but doesn't provide actual code
- **Concise Instructions**: Emphasizes clear, complete but concise explanations
- **Change-Focused**: Only shows what needs to change, not entire files/functions
- **Hierarchical Workflow**: Designed to work with a separate implementation step

## Use Cases

- High-level planning and architecture decisions
- Breaking down complex changes into clear instructions
- Code review and improvement recommendations
- Providing direction for large refactoring projects
- Planning multi-file changes
- Strategic code organization guidance

## Workflow Integration

This mode is designed for a two-phase approach:
1. **Architect Phase**: Plans and describes necessary changes
2. **Editor Phase**: Implements the specific changes based on architect's instructions

## Dynamic Components

- `{language}` - User's preferred language for responses

## Architectural Notes

- Inherits from `CoderPrompts` base class
- No example messages provided (empty array)
- Simplified compared to editing modes - no edit format specifications
- No shell command integration
- Focused on strategic thinking rather than tactical implementation
- Explicitly avoids showing complete updated code
